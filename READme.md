### Editing Guidelines:
- Every subsystem should have Open & Closed Loop commands.
  - Open Loop should be bound to necessary Operator/Driver joysticks.
  - Open Loop commands will be created under the [Deneme](/src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/deneme)
- Subsystem-specific constants should be capsulated in respective subsystem constant classes.
- Naming Conventions
  - Fields in form of `mName`
  - A DriveSubsystem instance in form of `mDrive` 
- Every subsystem should have a `getInstance()` method which would be called to get an instance of the subsystem. Subsystems shouldn‚Äôt be instantiated in `RobotContainer.java` as `Subsystem sub = new Subsystem()`!
- Every subsystem should include necessary debugging printed to SmartDashboard/Shuffleboard, such as encoder readings, zeroing booleans, etc.
- `Robot.java` should be avoided most of the time unless writing in `autoInit()` `teleopInit()` etc, `RobotContainer.java` suffices.

### Formatting code:
- Explanatory comments labeled `FIX!` and `TODO:` are a must.
- Every commit should include necessary changes done.
